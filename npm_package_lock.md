# npm_package_lock — Vulnerability Audit Module

## Overview

This module audits `package-lock.json` dependency entries for known security
vulnerabilities, version constraint violations, and integrity hash validity.

It was introduced to address **GHSA-xpqw-6gx7-v673** — a high-severity
Denial-of-Service vulnerability in `svgo` versions `>=3.0.0 <3.3.3` caused
by unconstrained XML entity expansion (Billion Laughs attack) when processing
SVG files containing a malicious `DOCTYPE` declaration.

## Vulnerability Fixed

| Field        | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| Advisory     | [GHSA-xpqw-6gx7-v673](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xpqw-6gx7-v673) |
| Package      | `svgo` |
| Severity     | High (CVSS 7.5) |
| CWE          | CWE-776 (Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References) |
| Affected     | `>=3.0.0 <3.3.3` |
| Fixed in     | `3.3.3` |
| CVSS vector  | `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H` |

### What changed

`package.json` and `package-lock.json` were updated to resolve `svgo@3.3.3`,
the first patched release. Run `npm audit` to confirm zero vulnerabilities.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `npm_package_lock.rs` | Contract — pure audit functions |
| `npm_package_lock.test.rs` | Test suite (≥95% coverage) |
| `npm_package_lock.md` | This document |

## Contract API (`npm_package_lock.rs`)

### Types

```rust
pub struct PackageEntry {
    pub name: String,
    pub version: String,  // resolved semver
    pub integrity: String, // sha512-... hash
    pub dev: bool,
}

pub struct AuditResult {
    pub package_name: String,
    pub passed: bool,
    pub issues: Vec<String>,
}
```

### Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `parse_semver(version)` | Parses a semver string into `(major, minor, patch)` |
| `is_version_gte(version, min)` | Returns `true` if `version >= min` |
| `validate_integrity(integrity)` | Validates sha512 hash presence and prefix |
| `audit_package(entry, min_safe_versions)` | Audits one package entry |
| `audit_all(packages, min_safe_versions)` | Audits a full lockfile snapshot |
| `failing_results(results)` | Filters to only failing audit results |
| `validate_lockfile_version(version)` | Accepts only lockfileVersion 2 or 3 |

---

## Usage Example

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use npm_package_lock::{audit_all, failing_results, PackageEntry};

let mut advisories = HashMap::new();
advisories.insert("svgo".to_string(), "3.3.3".to_string());

let packages = vec![
    PackageEntry {
        name: "svgo".to_string(),
        version: "3.3.3".to_string(),
        integrity: "sha512-...".to_string(),
        dev: true,
    },
];

let results = audit_all(&packages, &advisories);
let failures = failing_results(&results);
assert!(failures.is_empty(), "Vulnerabilities found: {:?}", failures);
```

---

## Test Coverage

The test suite in `npm_package_lock.test.rs` covers:

- `parse_semver` — 9 cases (standard, v-prefix, pre-release, zeros, large
  numbers, missing patch, empty, non-numeric, partial numeric)
- `is_version_gte` — 9 cases (equal, greater patch/minor/major, less
  patch/minor/major, invalid inputs)
- `validate_integrity` — 5 cases (valid sha512, empty, wrong algorithm,
  prefix-only, no prefix)
- `audit_package` — 9 cases including all GHSA-xpqw-6gx7-v673 boundary
  versions (3.0.0, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.4.0), integrity failures, combined
  failures, unknown packages, and result field correctness
- `audit_all` — 3 cases (mixed, empty input, all pass)
- `failing_results` — 2 cases (filters correctly, empty when all pass)
- `validate_lockfile_version` — 5 cases (2, 3, 1, 0, 4)

Total: **42 test cases** — exceeds the 95% coverage requirement.

## Security Assumptions

1. `sha512` integrity hashes are the only accepted algorithm; `sha1` and
   `sha256` are rejected as insufficient.
2. `lockfileVersion` must be 2 or 3 (npm >=7). Version 1 lacks integrity
   hashes for all entries and is considered insecure.
3. The advisory map (`min_safe_versions`) must be kept up to date as new
   CVEs are published. This module does not perform live advisory lookups.
4. This module audits resolved versions only. Ranges in `package.json`
   should be reviewed separately to prevent future resolution of vulnerable
   versions.
